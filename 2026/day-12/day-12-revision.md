Five Commands I Would Use First in an Emergency

ls – Lists files and directories so I can quickly see what exists and spot anything unusual.

cd – Lets me move between directories, especially important system paths like /var/log or /etc.

pwd – Shows my current directory to make sure I’m working in the right place.

mkdir – Creates a new folder, useful for backups or temporary work during troubleshooting.

rm – Removes files or folders to clear unnecessary or temporary data (used carefully).
